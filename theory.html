      <h2>Overview of LDU Decomposition</h2>
      <p>
        LDU decomposition is a specific type of matrix factorization that
        expresses a matrix <code>A</code> as the product of three matrices: a
        lower triangular matrix <code>L</code>, a diagonal matrix
        <code>D</code>, and an upper triangular matrix <code>U</code>. This can
        be mathematically represented as:
      </p>
      <p><code>A = LDU</code></p>
    </section>

      <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

      <h3>1. Components of LDU Decomposition</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Lower Triangular Matrix (L)</strong>: A square matrix where
          all the entries above the main diagonal are zero.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Diagonal Matrix (D)</strong>: A matrix in which the entries
          outside the main diagonal are all zero.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Upper Triangular Matrix (U)</strong>: A square matrix where
          all the entries below the main diagonal are zero.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Applications</h3>
      <p>LDU decomposition is widely used in numerical analysis for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Solving Systems of Linear Equations</strong>: It simplifies
          the process of solving equations by breaking down complex matrices
          into manageable components.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Matrix Inversion</strong>: It facilitates the computation of
          the inverse of a matrix.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Computing Determinants</strong>: The determinant of a matrix
          can be computed using the product of the diagonal elements of
          <code>D</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Algorithm for LDU Decomposition</h3>
      <p>The process typically involves:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Performing Gaussian elimination to convert the matrix into an upper
          triangular form.
        </li>
        <li>
          Extracting the lower and upper triangular matrices while maintaining
          the diagonal elements separately.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The computational complexity for this process is generally
        <code>O(n^3)</code>, where <code>n</code> is the dimension of the square
        matrix.

      <h2>Properties of LDU Decomposition</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Uniqueness</strong>: If <code>A</code> is invertible, then its
          LDU decomposition is unique.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stability</strong>: The method is numerically stable under
          certain conditions, particularly when pivoting strategies are
          employed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Relation to LU Decomposition</strong>: LDU decomposition can
          be seen as a refined version of LU decomposition, where the diagonal
          elements are explicitly separated.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Example</h2>
      <p>Consider a simple 2x2 matrix:</p>
      <p><code>A = [[4, 3], [6, 3]]</code></p>

      <p>The LDU decomposition would yield:</p>

      <pre><code>L = [[1, 0], [1.5, 1]]
D = [[4, 0], [0, -1.5]]
U = [[1, 0.75], [0, 1]]
      </code></pre>

      <p>Thus, we have:</p>
      <p><code>A = LDU</code></p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        LDU decomposition is an essential technique in linear algebra with
        significant applications in computational mathematics. By breaking down
        matrices into simpler forms, it aids in efficiently solving linear
        equations, computing inverses, and determining properties like
        determinants.
